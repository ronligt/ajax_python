# ajax_python

This template can be used to setup a server-side python script with html5 and ajax. As an example it takes one string via an HTML-form, reverses the string and returns this to the webclient.

The `ajax_python.conf` is used for the configuration of Apache (v2) webserver.

The `web` directory is served by the webserver. Make sure the `testcgi.py` script is executable by the webserver!

To ease the use of ajax the **jQuery** library is used (v3) (see `ajax.js`).
